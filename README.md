# Layer 2 Attacks
Project done in "Network Security" course at Ca'Foscari University, check the report for a project explanation.

## Description of the project:
The main objectives of this project are two: to experiment and present several Layer 2 attacks on Managed Switches, as well as understanding the entity of the damages and the possible remediations to them. Among all the options we selected: the \textit{MAC table overflow attack}, \textit{ARP cache poisoning attack} and a couple of \textit{VLAN attacks}, such as the \textit{Double tagging attack} and the \textit{Switch spoofing attack}. Once more, the aim is to gain a hands-on experience on the above-mentioned attacks to better understand the topics and the associated vulnerabilities, as well as mitigation techniques, found in Layer 2 devices and protocols
